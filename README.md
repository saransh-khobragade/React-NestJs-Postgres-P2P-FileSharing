# React + NestJS + Postgres (CRUD + P2P File Sharing)

Full‚Äëstack P2P File Sharing app with React (frontend), NestJS (backend), and Postgres, plus WebRTC-based peer-to-peer file sharing.

## üöÄ Quick start (Docker)

```bash
# Build and start selected services (or use "all")
./scripts/build.sh all

# Or only app core
./scripts/build.sh frontend backend postgres pgadmin

## Services

- Frontend: http://localhost:3000
- Backend API: http://localhost:8080
- Swagger: http://localhost:8080/api
- P2P File Sharing: http://localhost:3000/p2p
- pgAdmin: http://localhost:5050 (admin@admin.com / admin)
```

To start everything:

```bash
./scripts/build.sh all
```

## ‚ôªÔ∏è Rebuild workflow

Use a single script with two modes:

```bash
# For config/env updates ‚Üí SOFT (no image build)
./scripts/rebuild.sh <service|all> soft

# For code/Dockerfile changes ‚Üí HARD (rebuild image)
./scripts/rebuild.sh <service|all> hard
```

Examples:

```bash
# After backend code edits
./scripts/rebuild.sh backend hard

# Recreate frontend to pick up env/static content changes
./scripts/rebuild.sh frontend soft
```

Supported services: `frontend backend postgres pgadmin`. Use `all` for everything.

## Database access

pgAdmin is included for DB administration at http://localhost:5050 (default: admin@admin.com / admin). Default Postgres connection inside Docker uses host `postgres`, port `5432`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local frontend dev

```bash
cd frontend
yarn install
yarn dev   # http://localhost:3000
```

## üßë‚Äçüíª Local frontend dev

```bash
cd backend
yarn install
yarn start   # http://localhost:8080
```

## üìÅ P2P File Sharing

The app includes a minimal peer-to-peer file sharing feature using WebRTC:

### How to use:
1. **Create/Join Room**: Visit http://localhost:3000/p2p
   - Enter your name
   - Create a new room or join existing one with room ID
2. **Share Files**: On the room page
   - See connected peers in the same room
   - Click "Connect" next to a peer to establish WebRTC connection
   - Select a file to send (transferred via DataChannel)
   - Receiver gets a download link when transfer completes

### Technical Details:
- **Backend**: NestJS signaling server only (no file storage)
  - REST: `POST /api/rooms` (create), `GET /api/rooms/:id` (info)
  - WebSocket: `/signal` namespace for SDP/ICE exchange
- **Frontend**: React + WebRTC DataChannel
  - Chunked file transfer
  - In-memory rooms (no persistence)
  - Minimal UI inspired by Snapdrop

## üîß Useful commands

```bash
# Tail service logs
docker compose logs -f backend

# Run simple API smoke tests
./scripts/test-api.sh.sh

# Health-check API
curl -s http://localhost:8080/api | jq .

# Test P2P signaling
curl -X POST http://localhost:8080/api/rooms
```
